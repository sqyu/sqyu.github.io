= Travel to 🇹🇼 Taiwan (臺灣 | 台灣)
[travel_list.html Back to list]

== Description
Spent a few days here in Summer 2012. All later flights from Hong Kong to Taiwan on the same day were cancelled due to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoon_Saola_(2012) Typhoon Saola]. Even [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alishan_National_Scenic_Area the Alishan area], one of the landmarks of Taiwan, was closed during my visit.

As I have become a lot more familiar with its culture, e.g. learning [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwanese_Hokkien Taiwanese Hokkien (台語)] and typing in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bopomofo Bopomofo/Zhuyin (注音)] most of the time, I have always been wanting to revisit some day. I couldn't care less about the politics between mainland China and Taiwan though -- none of my business.
